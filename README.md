# Text Summarization using NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)

![Project Image](./ts.gif)

Welcome to the "Text Summarization using NMF" project repository! This project aims to explore the field of text summarization by leveraging the power of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to condense extensive text documents into concise and coherent summaries.

## Overview

Text summarization plays a pivotal role in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the extraction of key insights and information from voluminous text data. This project delves into the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to generate meaningful and effective summaries from input text sources.

## How NMF Works

Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is a mathematical technique that decomposes a given matrix into two non-negative matrices. In the context of text summarization, NMF can be employed to identify latent topics present within a collection of documents, ultimately facilitating the extraction of pivotal sentences that encapsulate those topics.

## Project Features

- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** An inclusive text preprocessing pipeline has been developed, incorporating fundamental tasks such as tokenization and stop word removal.
- **NMF Implementation:** The project employs the scikit-learn library to implement the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization algorithm.
- **Summary Generation:** The project showcases the generation of coherent and informative summaries, using the latent topics derived from the NMF process.
- **Interactive Interface (Optional):** Additionally, there is an option to include an interactive user interface for seamless input and summarized output.
